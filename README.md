# Augmented-Reality-Based-Smart-Lighting
A cutting-edge project that combines the power of Augmented Reality (AR) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to create an innovative way of controlling lighting in your home or office. The project involves an AR app (AR Interface) called LightARium, designed and developed using Unity Editor and the Vuforia Engine. The IoT part of the project involves a NodeMCU ESP32 board, which connects to the cloud using WiFi through an API provided by the Blynk IoT Platform. The ESP32 board then controls a relay module that is connected to it, in order to control the attached light bulb accordingly. The unique feature of this project is that the light bulb will turn on or off when the user touches the Virtual (AR-based) On/Off button. Overall, this project has the potential to revolutionize the way we control lighting, making it more intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient.
